The diffuse-interface method is an interface capturing technique for multi-phase flow problems based on the Cahn-Hilliard model. In this study, the diffuse-interface method is employed to model a viscous interface, incorporating interfacial viscosity alongside classical interfacial tension. In a previous study utilizing the interface tracking method, interfacial stress was treated as a boundary condition (Jaensson et al., 2021). This study, with the help of the diffuse-interface method, reformulates the interfacial boundary condition into the momentum conservation equation, localizing the interfacial stress at the interface (Grande, 2015; Reusken & Zhang, 2013). Preliminary results from two-dimensional simple problems will be presented.
