The heart is a very complex organ with different physical characteristics. Numerical and experimental research has shown that the electrophysiological results of patients can be
impacted by the effects of temperature and magnetic radiation. In this work, we developed a model of cardiac electrophysiology under the influence of temperature and radiative magnetic field. The ionic current model was modeled by the bivariate Karma model, we used the Pennes bio-heat equation for the temperature effects. All governing equations were solved using the finite element method and the algorithm was implemented using the
open source software FEniCs. The effect on the action potential duration (APD) is studied in relation to the magnetic effects, We also analyzed the temperature effects at (35 − 39 ◦C). it was found that the APD peak decreased by 21% due to an increase in the magnetic effect from 0.0004 to 0.009 and the increase in magnetic intensity stops spiral wave formations. Spiral wave formations are observed for the temperature of 37◦C and they disappear at any significantly high (43◦C) or low (28◦C) temperature. This study concludes that the radiative magnetic field does not have a great impact when the tissue is hypothermic. Furthermore, we also saw that the radiative magnetic field could modulate the electrical activity field and control the conduction disorder.
