The Stokes problem is well-posed when considered on an open and bounded domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ if (i) Dirichlet conditions are imposed for the velocity solution on the boundary $\partial\Omega$ and (ii) the pressure solution is constrained to have zero average on $\Omega$. We find that it is also feasible to impose Dirichlet boundary conditions for the pressure on the entire boundary $\partial\Omega$ as a replacement for (ii). This is done by instead requiring that the pressure function vanishes over a small boundary band $\Delta \subset \Omega$. We theoretically show that this preserves the problem well-posedness, and provide supporting numerical evidence. Applications include couplings of the Stokes subproblems on subdomains of $\Omega$ in finite element simulations.
