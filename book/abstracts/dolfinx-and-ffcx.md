We discuss performance results from executing the FEniCS Project finite element software on Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems with ARM64-based Graviton3(e) processors (Habera and Hale, 2023). We show both weak scaling tests across nodes and explore the auto-vectorisation capabilities of the latest clang and GCC compilers on FFCx generated kernels.
